# Big_Data_Project
- For Big Data class
- 이유경 and 이가영 collaborating for the project of the semester
- Focused on gathering big data for analysis and to explain the significance of the organized information

## Anime
- We visualized the attributes of datasets we got from kaggle so that we can recommend anime to MDs of different platforms.
- We grouped anime based on licensor, studio, source and more.
- We analyzed the genre trend by comparing 2020 and 2023 datasets.
- We made a dynamic graph to recommend anime based on its source and number of favorites by users.
- There will also be a wordcloud of reviews of a few popular anime scrolled by us.

- We will credit the datasets:
- 2020 dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020
- 2023 dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset
- The datasets are mostly in the repository except for anime-dataset-2023, users-details-2023 and users-score-2023 (The three files were too big to upload)
